Good to start. Understand the game.

002:
Catch: If there is no blocker, the icecube will not hit the target
Insight: None

Again. Very simple. But I think it does introduce you to the catch.

001:
Catch: If you push the block forward, you get push backward as well.
Insight: None

I really like it.

003:
Catch/Learning: You have to slide across the path you created to get to places you want.
Insight: You can slide across slippery. Learn the pattern of the available ground.

Fairly simple. But it's good. But there's always only one thing to do.

No catch. But decently interesting level.
It's alright. But it seems like in all places there is only one thing to do
Nothing there that will mislead the player...

005:
Catch: You can push the cube to the target, but still be stuck on ice.
Insight: None

The catch is nice. But the solution itself is kinda boring.

006:
Catch: introducing furniture.
Insight: Furniture can be moved and it blocks cube
Rating: 3
Yeah. Good enough. as introduction. 

007:
Catch: introducing furniture.
Insight: Furniture can be moved and it blocks cube
Rating: 6
Feels very similar to the previous level... Replacable basically.

008:
Catch: None
Insight: you need the furniture to be in the correct place to stop your slide, so
you can push the cube.
Rating: 9
Yeah. I quite like it. Forced the player to actually move the furniture in the way
that I designed.

009:
Catch: You can't always easily push a furniture across slippery, because you will
end up getting stuck on the slippery.
Insight: None
Rating: 8
Yeah. The level will likely get you caught. There might be a possibility to do
something a little more clever than the movement that is currently required. But
yeah, lets see.. quite happy though

010:
Catch: None
Insight: cube can block slide of furniture.

Level is great. Also see how first the cube has to be pushed, only then do we get the
furniture in correct position.

011:
Catch: If you use furniture to stop the cube in the correct place, you might have
difficulty getting there yourself.
Insight: You can use the furniture multiple times.

It's fine. Semi interesting. Note that this is the first level where the furniture
is not pushed off the map when hit correctly by the cube. Also, the furniture will
trap you if you try to push the block left then up

012:
Catch: Because of the land and slippery, you cant push the furniture to the right
Insight: You can bump the ice into the furniture in order to move it
Rating: 8
I'm quite happy with it. Just discovered the solution. Honestly, it's quite simple
Can probably be moved up a bit. But certainly very interesting

013:
Catch: difficult to move the furniture to the obvious blocking spot. If you do that
there's no way to get off the slippery. Lots of different ways to get stuck. yay
Insight. Use the furniture to set up the cube at the edge of the slippery
