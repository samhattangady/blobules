000:
Good to start. Understand the game.

002:
Catch: If there is no blocker, the icecube will not hit the target
It's very similar to previous level. I think if we make it vertical instead,
it will become a lot better specially, in terms of variety.

001:
Catch: If you push the block forward, you get push backward as well.
I really like it.

003:
Catch/Learning: You have to slide across the path you created to get to places you want.
Fairly simple. But it's good.

004:
No catch. But decently interesting level.
It's alright. But it seems like in all places there is only one thing to do
Nothing there that will mislead the player...

005:
Catch: You can push the cube to the target, but still be stuck on ice.
The catch is nice. But the solution itself is kinda boring.

006:
Catch: introducing furniture. learn that it needs to be moved to the correct place
so it can block the cube.
Yeah. Good enough.

007:
Catch: introducing furniture. learn that it needs to be moved to the correct place
so it can block the cube.
Feels very similar to the previous level... Replacable basically.

008:
Catch: you need the furniture to be in the correct place to stop your slide, so
you can push the cube.
Yeah. I quite like it. Forced the player to actually move the furniture in the way
that I designed. 

009:
Catch: You can't always easily push a furniture across slippery, because you will
end up getting stuck on the slippery.
Yeah. The level will likely get you caught. There might be a possibility to do
something a little more clever than the movement that is currently required. But
yeah, lets see..
