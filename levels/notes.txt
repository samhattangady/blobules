000:
Good to start. Understand the game.

002:
Catch: If there is no blocker, the icecube will not hit the target
It's very similar to previous level. I think if we make it vertical instead,
it will become a lot better specially, in terms of variety.

001:
Catch: If you push the block forward, you get push backward as well.
I really like it.

003:
Catch/Learning: You have to slide across the path you created to get to places you want.
Fairly simple. But it's good.

004:
No catch. But decently interesting level.
It's alright. But it seems like in all places there is only one thing to do
There is no catch. Nothing there that will mislead the player...

005:
Catch: You can push the cube to the target, but still be stuck on ice.
Good. I like it.

006:
Catch: introduce furniture
