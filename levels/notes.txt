Good to start. Understand the game.

002: 5
Catch: If there is no blocker, the icecube will not hit the target
Again. Very simple. But I think it does introduce you to the catch.

001: 9
Catch: If you push the block forward, you get push backward as well.
I really like it.

003: 4
Catch/Learning: You have to slide across the path you created to get to places you want.
Fairly simple. But it's good. But there's always only one thing to do.

004: 2
No catch. But decently interesting level.
It's alright. But it seems like in all places there is only one thing to do
Nothing there that will mislead the player...

005:
Catch: You can push the cube to the target, but still be stuck on ice.
The catch is nice. But the solution itself is kinda boring.

006:
Catch: introducing furniture. learn that it needs to be moved to the correct place
so it can block the cube.
Yeah. Good enough.

007:
Catch: introducing furniture. learn that it needs to be moved to the correct place
so it can block the cube.
Feels very similar to the previous level... Replacable basically.

008:
Catch: you need the furniture to be in the correct place to stop your slide, so
you can push the cube.
Yeah. I quite like it. Forced the player to actually move the furniture in the way
that I designed.

009:
Catch: You can't always easily push a furniture across slippery, because you will
end up getting stuck on the slippery.
Yeah. The level will likely get you caught. There might be a possibility to do
something a little more clever than the movement that is currently required. But
yeah, lets see..

010:
Catch: The furniture can be used as blocker, and you have to use the block to position
it correctly on the ice.
Oh man, I think that was a really good idea. I even changed the mechanic for it.
Level is great. Also see how first the cube has to be pushed, only then do we get the
furniture in correct position.
