So yeah just a place for some notes. Would need to set up vimwiki here as
well to make sure the things are alright. Apart from that I think its largely
all good.

Umm, now the game has been set up on windows as well, so that is good I
assume. Would have to set up some of the vimrc stuff here as well, but should
be fairly straightforward for the most part I guess.

Okay, in terms of plan of action, I'm not sure what I should work on next. I
remember the "priority was to get a working overall structure of the program
in place, which essentilly means that we need to set up the main menu as well
as the


Okay, yeah, so I need to start implementing the main menu stuff right? I think
I should start off with that immediately?

14 Jun 2020
Okay, again, really need to spend some time and just start putting the work in
really. (Narrator: And then he spent the next 4 hours on Youtube ¯\_(?)_/¯ )

Alright so main menu. I think lets do that. Actually fps.

So one thing that we currently have is that the ui.c file is what does the text
rendering. There are two things that we can do in order to do the menu rendering
Either we give the simple renderer some functionality to do text rendering as well,
call into ui.c from the renderer. Yeah I think those are the two options that we
have. I think we should start off with using the existing ui.c code. 

Actually, anyway we are going to have to rewrite large,
no, use it as it is right now. Let's see what we can do later.

Yeah, alright, implemented the whole menu functionality. (Narrator: yeah
"WHOLE FUNCTIONALITY")
There's a bit more to be done there, but for the most part, I think the
structure is good.

Alright. I guess we could work on the level select screen next? Since the idea
that I do have is the node based idea, we should prototype some simple version
of that I guess.

Agian, I can feel the laziness creeping in, and honestly, it doesn't feel so
super, I do have to admit. I need to figure out some mechanism that allows me
to circumvent this same thought spiral.

Largely, I think I really need to get used to the idea that this is _all_
about delayed gratification. I think at some level I am just not able to
appreciate that to a large enough extent, and that is the cause of the
constant distractions and all the other rubbish.

Okay, we also have to figure out how to store and load the levels then right?
It might be quite a bit of a hassle to do it all in text files. But I guess we
still should be doing that in any case? At least whike starting off. Later on,
we can probably move on to make some sort of toolset that would allow us to do
that. But that's later right. Right now we only need to implement the simplest
version of that. And I think that everything that we need to have in that
version has already been covered in the level_select_struct.

17 Jun 2020
So yeah, I think that one of the things that I really need to work on is to
get really into the whole develpmnet stuff. So I _know_ that when I really get
into it, I enjoy the process, but everyday, I'd just much rather be dreaming
about getting successful amd all the interviews and podcasts that Id do and
rubbish, but never about actually doing the actual deed. So that's fairly
annoying atleast right now. And even just then, I go out and start watching
some more fucking youtube,,,

Okay, so whats the next step really? I think it must be implementing the level
select screen right? Yeah, that makes sense right now.

19 Jun 2020
Okay, so I need to do some work today. But to be honest, I'm _really_ happy
with the progress over the past few days. Sure, it doesn't really look/seem
like much, but sortwed out all the weird issues, like the flickering and
things. And yeah, I think that's definitely a good thing. So I think the next
thing we should probably be working on is getting sound effects into the game?
I think that may be kinda important.

So okay, I guess some of the things that we need to really get into the game
would have to be the sounds and the animations. The animation system is
something that we would have to really figure out from scratch almost I guess.
Sounds should just be mostly adding some sort of sound controller I guess

APart from that I am just thinking what else really needs to be done. I may be
missing some very basic elements, but at this point in time, I really am not
sure what those would be.
Maybe I could also spend some time on the visual elements of the whole thing.
Specifically, a grayscale "implementation" of all the elements to get a decent
grasp of what is really necessary to be developed, and secondly, a demo of
what we want the main character to look like, with all the shader work and all
of that done as well. I think if we can start getting all of that done, it
would definitely be ideal.

20 Jun 2020
Okay, so what should I be aiming to get done today? I played a demo of the
monster expedition game, and that looked kinda cool. It has a few more
elements that I do, but honestly, not exactly looking to compete I don't
think. So yeah, I think honestly, we are *way* behind on the artwork. I have
all the tools required now also, so no real good excuses anymore I don't think

Okay. Spend some time on the artwork now then.

22 Jun 2020
So I think at some point, I reverted to drawing the sprites from the bottom
left corner. Actually, we should be drawing them from the center so that the
stuff gets easily overlapped whatever aaaaaa,.
Now I think I remember why I would have switched to the bottom left version.
It was because we wanted to draw sprites that were 2 units tall, and in that
case the corners would be different.

Okay, so what are the important things that need to be worked on right now?
I'm just trying to get a grasp on that. So we need the better ground tile
selection stuff. Then the actual krita processing scripts. Some animation
rendering stuff? Okay, pick one and get to work. I think the krita script is
the important one. Until we get that, working on the other stuff would require
a bunch of busywork, which I'm not so keen on doing really.
